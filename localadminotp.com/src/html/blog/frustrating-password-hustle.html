                Passwords have been a fundamental aspect of computer security for decades.
                Looking back, their evolution reflects the changing landscape of technology and security needs.
                Like any self-respecting IT security developer, we at Fuddata Ltd. are aware of the history of password usage and wanted to offer insight into how we arrived at the current state of password security.
                And more importantly, how we have solved the modern password hustle for software developers with Local Admin OTP.

            <h3 class="p-2 text-sm md:text-xl lg:text-3xl font-bold">The Dawn of the password</h3>
            <p>
                For nearly half a century we have secured information with passwords.
                Though it feels like a long time, we are still chasing the security high.
                From the simplest plain text passwords and data encryption standard (DES) we evolved to web-based authentication as the internet developed.
            </p>
            <br />
            <img src="https://static.fuddata.com/blog1/history-of-passwords.webp" alt="History of passwords" />
            <br />
            <p>
                Organizations implemented policies regarding the length, complexity and expiration to enhance security and in many instances have evolved into using multi-factor authentication.
                Biometrics and SMS codes have added yet another layer of security but also the need for password management as most if not all applications, services and software require the user to have understandably separate methods of retaining their access.
            </p>

            <h3 class="p-2 text-sm md:text-xl lg:text-3xl font-bold">Access the Future</h3>
            <p>
                As biometric authentication currently uses fingerprints, facial and even retinal recognition it surely makes modern life feel somewhat like a sci-fi film.
                But what is the future of passwords like, how do we identify ourselves for our machines, subscriptions and activities in a few years?
                What part will AI play in shaping IT security of tomorrow?

                AI is everywhere and it surely changes the landscape for IT security too.
                Regardless of all the hyped-up solutions for various tasks and duties in our everyday lives, there needs to be sufficient thoughts on the security side of things in the upcoming years.

            <h3 class="p-2 text-sm md:text-xl lg:text-3xl font-bold">How many Passwords?</h3>
            <p>
                Once upon a time we needed no passwords, "couple" of other things were slightly different then too.
                However, as tiresome as it might be, nowadays multiple passwords is everyone's business.
                Daily one must remember 1-5 passwords and there is the urge of using one password for all purposes.
                From IT security standpoint this is insufficient to say the least.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                At Fuddata we believe that security doesn't equal bad user experience, we thrive to design something which is missing in the world.

                On our way to true passwordless solutions Local Admin OTP solves a huge problem for a whole lot of developers.
                We agree that remembering multiple passwords for admin accounts and signing in countless times during the day is very common, that's why we came up with a solution.
                Local Admin OTP makes a simple separate admin account and frees you from remembering all those passwords.

            <h3 class="p-2 text-sm md:text-xl lg:text-3xl font-bold">Battle of Wits</h3>
            <p>
                Historically, the increasing complexity and frequency of cyberattacks have exposed the vulnerabilities of traditional password-based security.
                One of the biggest changes in this game of cat and mouse has been the shift from simple, static passwords to more sophisticated and secure authentication methods.
                The more complex authenticating yourself has gotten, more complicated the credentials and procedures have become.
                And for a good reason, if we don't feel data-secure living our lives and working our offices - the consequences are dire.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                With identification methods being so diverse, from password managers and multi-factor authentication to behavioral biometrics, perhaps we should be on the cusp of stopping to use the word password altogether.
                In the attack and in defense, change is the only constant.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>
                By far the biggest challenge for IT security today is ransomware attacks.
                There is no easy way to prevent these but there are many things companies need to do properly to not be vulnerable.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                It is not all threats though.
                User convenience for digital protection has improved significantly with advanced methods and brighter days might lay ahead.
                As long as there are professionals who focus their design might also towards user friendly solutions.
